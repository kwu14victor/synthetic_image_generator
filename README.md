This is a repository for creating synthetic cell images and labels.<br />
The created files can be used to train segmentation models.<br />

Usage (check sample script for more details):<br />
Use the SynCellImage class to create the data object.<br />
Next, use the SynCell class to create a cell and use the add_cells function of the SynCellImage class to add it to the data.<br />
Then, calling the image and label attributes of the SynCellImage object will give the data to train segmentation models.<br />
Moreover, calling the cell_dict attribute will allow the user to see the attributes of individual SynCell objects in the data.<br />

Observations/Comments:<br />
This script can create multiple objects, but the image quality needs manual trial and error.<br />
For example, assigning too many cells to an area can lead to insufficient visual features to train the segmentation model while the label still being presented.<br />
Therefore, it is critical to check the output before any experiment.<br />

TODO/Future work:<br />
Cell morphology pattern: The current cell morphology, including intensity distribution, is very simple and does not resemble real cells well. More literature review is necessary to model these real-world patterns.<br />

Requirements:<br />
numpy==1.21.6<br />
scikit-image==0.16.2<br />
matplotlib==3.2.2<br />
